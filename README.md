#1. Why you believe your project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements, mentioned above.

My program uses django for the backend with a few javascript functions and 2 models.
It is a (not very beautiful) copy of Youtube.

#2. What’s contained in each file you created.

In video folder there are the 2 usual folders containing the css and js files along with the templates folder that holds the html files.
Other files are the:
1. admin.py having the classes of what is shown in the admin page.
2. models.py with the 2 models of the application.
3. serializers.py where the serializers of the models can be found for the api calls.
4. urls.py with the urls of the application and
5. views.py holding the views.

#3. How to run your application.

With the usual manage.py runserver. There are no extra libraries.

#4. Any other additional information the staff should know about your project.

Nothing.
