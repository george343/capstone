#1. Why you believe your project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements, mentioned above.

My program uses django for the backend with a few javascript functions and 2 models.
It is a (not very beautiful) copy of Youtube.

#2. What’s contained in each file you created.

In video folder there are the 2 usual folders containing the css and js files along with the templates folder that holds the html files.
Other files are the:
1. admin.py having the classes of what is shown in the admin page.
2. models.py with the 2 models of the application.
3. serializers.py where the serializers of the models can be found for the api calls.
4. urls.py with the urls of the application and
5. views.py holding the views.

#3. How to run your application.

From the first page you can either login or register a new account<br>
You are then redirected to the home page where you can find the video categories. Clicking on any of them can take you to the videos of the selected category <br>
There is also a page where you can see all the videos from all categories.<br>
Clicking on any video will direct you to the video page where you can watch the video, choose other videos from the same category, like it or comment.<br>
Going to your profile you can upload a video, see the videos you uploaded and liked.
Below the menu is the search bar where you can type anything and search for videos that contain what you typed.

#4. Any other additional information the staff should know about your project.

Nothing.
